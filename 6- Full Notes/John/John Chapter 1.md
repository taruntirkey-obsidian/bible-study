___

### Divinity of our Lord
The Gospel of John begins with the words "In the beginning," echoing Genesis 1:1. However, instead of "God," John uses "Word" to emphasize Jesus Christ's divinity as the Word made flesh. This connection between creation and new creation is striking.
### Jesus' work of New Creation
John structures the beginning of Jesus' public ministry within a week, mirroring the seven days of creation in Genesis. Here's the breakdown:
- **Day 1**: John the Baptist proclaims Jesus as "the Lamb of God" (**John 1:29**).
- **Day 2**: John the Baptist repeats this proclamation, and two disciples start following Jesus (**John 1:35-37**).
- **Day 3**: Andrew shares the news with his brother Peter, saying they've found the Messiah (**John 1:40-41**).
- **Day 4**: Jesus calls Philip, who then finds Nathanael (**John 1:43-45**).
- Continued in chapter 2.
### Other Key Events
- John the Baptist's ministry at the Jordan River (John 1:28).
